# UnoGame
There is a deck of cards, consisting of two each of the numbers 0 to 9 inclusive, in each colour: red, blue, green and yellow. There are therefore 80 cards in total.
 
There will be two players: the user and the computer
 
At the start of the game, each player gets 7 cards from the deck. The next card from the deck becomes the first card on the pile.
 
When it is a player's turn, they put one card from their hand onto the pile. The card must either be the same colour or the same number as the card currently on the top of the pile. For example, if the card on top is a Green 4, then the player can place any Green card, or any card with the number 4. If the player can't place any card, they need to pick up a card from the deck.
 
The first player to have zero cards left is the winner.
 
The user is one of the players and must be able to choose which card to place, or choose to pick up a card, on each turn.
 
The other player is the computer. When it is the computer's turn, the computer should automatically place any card at random from its hand that is able to be played. If no card is able to be played, the computer shall pick up a card from the deck.
